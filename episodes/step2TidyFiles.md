# Step 2 - Keeping your files Tidy and Organized


Build your knowledge trust when sharing with collaborators or publication with well organized datasets. This also saves time in data cleaning, and ensures analysis pipelines are robust.

Let's look at a few concepts that can help.

### How to structure Column Data - Tidy data format

Tidy data developed by Hadley Wickham offer a set of rules to record, organise, and maintain data to ensure your analysis is effective, reproducible, and manageable.

The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset.

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. 

The fundamental principles of tidy data are:
1. Each variable is a column
2. Each row is an observation
3. Each cell contains one value

Let's look at an example:

Each variable is in a separate column  i.e. the thing you’re measuring, like ‘age’ or ‘temperature’ or ‘height’. 
Each observation is in a separate row
Each cell contains one value (either a number or character string) 

Let's look at an example:

![First example with full address in one cell](/episodes/images/TidyDataExample1.png)

This format could cause a number of issues.
- There is little control or guidance around when to use spaces, new lines or commas in this format. Commas especially can lead to a shift in data across your cells - meaning half of your address may end up in neighbouring cells, overwriting or shifting the rest of the line.
- Searching via State or Postcode would be extremely complicated.
- There is little clarity on what information should be included. One line contained the country, another did not. 
- Difficult to see/check if some part of the address is missing.

Let's look at a tidy example:

This format includes a lot of benefits:
- It is clear what is expected to include
- Easier to search
- Less likely to get extra whitespace or punctuation that could cause issues with analysis software

When multiple people are entering data manually, it may be beneficial to use a survey that fills in a spreadsheet for you. This can include dropdown menu items to ensure consistancy in certain columns - for example, to eliminate a combination of "Monday, Mon, M, mon".

Other useful concepts:

Dates:

Where possible, always use the formal YYYY-MM-DD for your dates. It will make searching for dates much easier. In addition, adding the additional zero (for example, March would be 03 ) means that when you sort your file, months and days will be in order. Otherwise, you may have Jan (1), Oct (10), Nov (11), Dec (12), Feb (2). 


Special Characters:

It is best to avoid punctuation or special characters in your cells or data entry. Some analysis tools may read certain characters incorrectly or produce an error.
